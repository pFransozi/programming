### Dynamic Programming

Dynamic programming is a strategy for solving complex problems with certain characteristics: a recursive structure of subproblems, with the result of each subproblem needed multiple times in the computation of the final solution. The final solution is computed by breaking the problem down into a collection of simpler subproblems, solving each of those subproblems just one, and sotring their solutions.

### Greedy Algorithm

Greedy Algorithm is a strategy to solve problems that finds the optimal solution by making the locally optimal choice at each step. It can only find the best solution on a small subclass of problems, but it can also be used as a heuristic to find approximate (sub-optimal) solutions.
